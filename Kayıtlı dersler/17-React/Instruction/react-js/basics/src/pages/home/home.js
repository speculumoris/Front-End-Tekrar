            <h3>What is React.js?</h3>
            <p>React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook. React is a User Interface (UI) library. React is a tool for building UI components.</p>
            <p>React is not a framework (unlike Angular, which is more opinionated). It is a JavaScript library that allows us to build UI components. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to build single page applications. React allows us to create reusable UI components. React was first created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. React first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and on Instagram.com in 2012.</p>
            <p>React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in the application. This corresponds to the view in the MVC template. It can be used with a combination of other JavaScript libraries or frameworks, such as Angular JS in MVC.</p>
